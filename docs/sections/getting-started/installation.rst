Installation
============

To install the tool, it is recommended that you use the `latest official PyPI release <https://pypi.org/project/deling>`_ ::

    pip install deling

Alternatively, you can also install the tool by directly cloning and installing the current repo HEAD.
However this is not recommended, since it is not guranteed that this is stable edition that will be fetched::

    git clone https://github.com/rasmunk/deling.git
    cd deling
    make install

After either of these installation approaces have been applied, you should now be ready to use ``deling``.
