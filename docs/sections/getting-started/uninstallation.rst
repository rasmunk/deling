Uninstall
=========

To uninstall ``deling``, simply reverse the recommended ``pip install`` operation presented in the installation section::

    pip3 uninstall deling

This will remove the package from your specified Python environment.

If you instead of using ``pip`` downloaded the source code and installed it manually via make, you can remove the package by running::

    cd /path/to/deling-src-directory
    make uninstall
